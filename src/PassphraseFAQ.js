They were chosen to be common enough words that they would be easy to remember and type. You can find the [full list of words here](https://github.com/blanchardjeremy/strongphrase.net/blob/main/src/words.js).
The numbers were chosen to be somewhat easy to remember (rather than fully random).

I put some time in filtering out offensive words, but I'm sure I missed some. If you find words that you think should be removed, [I'd love to hear the feedback](https://forms.gle/pu1vqi8Mc1VYirGz6).

              Use this site to create strong passphrases that are easy to remember.
              These passphrases are **much stronger** than most passwords because they are randomly generated, whereas passwords are often reused, shorter, and easier to guess.
              This site was inspired by other passphrase generates like [diceware](https://www.eff.org/dice), but designed to generate phrases that are **easier to visualize and remember**.

            question="Should I choose STRONG, STRONGER, or STRONGEST?" 
            id="choosing"
            answer={`
              The best answer for most folks is: choose any passphrase that you will use. That's probably the easiest one ("**STRONG**"). Password advice is only helpful if you use it. So while the "**STRONGEST**" option is harder to crack, it is also harder to type every time. For most folks, the "**STRONG**" is plenty.
              
              The longer answer is: It depends on how important the data is you're trying to protect. 
              If you follow the approach recommended above, you're primarily using these passphrase to secure your password manager and laptop. 
              Hacking either of those requires physical access to your device. So the question becomes: 
              **"How likely is it that someone will get access to my device? And how much time/money would they be willing to put into cracking it?"**
              
              For most of us, "STRONG" is plenty. But if you are securing extremely valuable information, you can try one of the stronger formats. (You can also use the "Show all formats" to see a number of other structures that are available at different strength levels.)

        <div className="faq-container">
          <FAQItem 
            question="What makes a strong password? (hint: entropy!)"
            id="entropy"
            answer={`
              **Entropy** is a technical term that refers to how hard a password is to crack.

              A 10-character password word made up of lowercase letters (26 characters) forms 26<sup>10</sup> = 141,167,095,653,376 (144 trillion) possible different combinations. It's cumbersome to write numbers that long, so we instead write it use exponents like "2 to the power of X" (2<sup>X</sup>). In our exmaple, 26<sup>10</sup> is about equal to **2<sup>47</sup>**. So we say this password has **"47 bits of entropy"**.
              
              Some examples: 

              | Type                                 | Pool of<br>characters | Example        | Entropy for a <br>10-character password |
              |--------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
              | Lower                                | 26              | \`bddacsvxmh\` | log<sub>2</sub>(26)*10 = **47 bits**    |
              | Lower + upper                        | 52              | \`cExNefEMVI\` | log<sub>2</sub>(52)*10 = **57 bits**    |
              | Lower + upper + num + common symbols | 70              | \`N7qm!C#9A@\` | log<sub>2</sub>(70)*10 = **61 bits**    |

              But most people don't use 10-character passwords. They use common words that can be easily found on a wordlist. Or they turn \`dragon\` into something harder like \`dr@g0n123!\`. That's an improvement, but since most attackers will be using a [dictionary of common words/names/passwords](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/wordlists?tab=readme-ov-file), and will know to expect [obvious subtituations](https://blanchardjeremy.github.io/tryzxcvbn/), it doesn't help as much as we might hope.

              This [classic xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) about passwords vs passphrases is a good summary.

              We can achieve much more human-friendly passphrases by using something like [diceware](https://www.eff.org/dice). Diceware draws from a list of **7,776 words**. So a phrase with 3 words has 7,776<sup>3</sup> = 479 trillion possible combinations. Each word adds 12.9 bits of entropy.

              The passphrases we generate on this site offer similar strength, but are easier to visualize and therefore easier to remember.

            question="How much entropy is enough?"
            id="enoughentropoy"
            answer={`
              If you take a look athe  **[time/cost to crack table](/#/table)**, you can make an assessment for yourself. 

              My two cents is that **45 bits** is sufficient for most situations, and that **65 or 70 bits** is more then enough for even very high security situations.

              An example of a high-security choice is [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/), a tool for whitleblowers to share files anonymous with journalists. 
              Each submitter is given a 7-word diceware passphrase in order to continue communication with the journalist in the future. 7 diceware words = 13 bits/word * 7 words = **90 bits of entropy**.

            question="But how would the attacker know I used this passphrase system?"

            answer={`
            In reality, they probably wouldn't know. 
            All of these examples assume that an attacker knows which passphrase scheme you've chosen and the exact wordlists used. So really we are listing the "minimum entropy required." That's the safest guess.
            
            But in reality, an attacker is more likely to try a LOT of other approaches before trying this scheme. They will try common word lists, and lots of variations on common word lists. Then they might try a lot of diceware combinations (3 words, 4 words, etc.). 
            Then if they knew this system exists, they might try it. Even then, they'd have to know which of the 3 main formats you chose. All of that combined means you get at least 20 bits of extra entropy, and probably a lot more.

          <FAQItem 
            question="How do you calculate the TIME to crack a passphrase?" 
            id="time"
            answer={`
              This is tricky. It requires making a lot of assumptions about how strong the "hash" of the password is and the computing power of the attacker. 

              Estimating the number guesses/second (aka: hashes/second) is challenging because the functions used to encrypt a password vary widely.

              Hive Systems maintains a great [password strength table](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green) that shows the time it would take to crack various kinds of passwords. They've put a great deal of thought into their assumptions, so we will use the same assumptions.

              Assumptions:
              * The attacker has access to your hashed password. Either they broke into a database or have access to your physical machine.
              * That password was hashed with bcrypt (at a [work factor](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#using-work-factors) of 32). 
                (Systems like 1Password and MacOS use a hashing approach that [much stronger](https://support.1password.com/pbkdf2/), so the guesses/second below wouuld be much lower than what you see below.)
              * The data below is current as of 2024 and will need updated as the cost of computing power continues to decrease.

              We provide profiles for 3 different levels of computing power:

              [^1]: Crack time is based on [hivesystems.com's table](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green) for a password with 8 characters using lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numbers (70 characters in the pool).
              [^aws]: AWS pricing is based on the [Amazon EC2 P4d](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) for EC2 P4d.24xlarge instances.
              [^clouda100]: [Hivesystems.com's table](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green) lists "17 years" to crack our standard password using an A100 x8, so A100 x16 should be about 8 years, which is close enough to the "7 years" listed for RTX 4090. 

              The "**Far future  nation state**" profile is a wild guess at what might be possible far in the future.

              When we display "average time to crack" it takes the "max time to crack" and divides by two. 
              It may take an attacker way less time or way more time. 
              But on average, they will need to search through half the possible combinations to find your key.

          <FAQItem 
          question="How do you calculate the COST to crack a passphrase?" 
          id="cost"
          answer={`
            The downside to "time to crack" is that we have to make guesses about the computing power an attacker is using. 
            If it takes 500 hours to crack a certain password with 1 process, an attacker could rent 500 cloud processors and crack the same password in 1 hour.
            The question becomes "how much money would that cost?"

            If we can find a reasonable guess at the cost to crack regardless of hardware, we can have a better sense of how well protected a passphrase is.
            Thankfully, we can draw from [Jacob Enger's Money-to-Crack research](https://jacobegner.blogspot.com/2020/11/password-strength-in-dollars.html).

            [^convert]: The formala to convert from guesses/dollar to dollars per 2^32 guesses is: **(2^32) / (guesses/second)**
            [^conv2]: The formula here is **(guesses/second * 3600) / ($/hour)** so here we have: **(1.9 trillion * 3600) / $410,000 = 17 billion**.
            [^1p]: Details can be found on the blog post about the [1Password cracking competition](https://blog.1password.com/cracking-challenge-update/).

            We choose **$0.50 per 2<sup>32</sup> guesses** as our figure because we it's fairly conservative. 
            1Password has a much higher cost to crack than our assumption (bcrypt) because they have a more computationally-intense hashing function.

            If you want to play with different "cost to crack" scenarios, you can use our [Cost to Crack Table](/#/table).

            The powerful GPUs that help an attacker crack passwords are the same GPUs that are used to train AI models. 
            As AI continues to explore, it's reasonable to assume that these GPUs will become ever more available on the cloud.
